## 2026-09-05 — project created: scanner + /dipfind skill
**Did:**
- Chose name `etf-dipfinder`; curated ~115 liquid sector/thematic ETFs (SPDR sectors, semis, AI/robot, nuclear, defense, metals, clean, crypto, country) incl. 2026 launches DRAM, AIPO, AIHY, BAI, PHOX.
- `scripts/scan.py`: yfinance 3y download → dd_52w, dd_z (dd/vol), dd_pctile (vs own history), vs_sma200/50, rs_spy_3m/6m/12m, ret_10d, dollar_vol. Drops <$5M/day.
- Decided `is_dip = (price<SMA200 OR dd_52w≤−10%) AND rs_spy_3m<0`. Everything is computed, only dips ranked; leaders kept as regime info.
- `scripts/test_scan.py` synthetic self-check (passes). `.claude/skills/dipfind/SKILL.md`: run scan → web-check why each top dip is down → bucket rotation/break/unclear → memo to `log/`.
- First live scan: 41/106 dips. Cluster: nuclear/defense/space/rare-earth/clean unwinding; leaders crypto + biotech. BJK delisted, PHOX no data, 11 illiquid dropped.
- Local git repo initialised, no remote.

**Continue:**
- `cd etf-dipfinder && uv run python scripts/scan.py` then `/dipfind` (not yet run once).
- Open: add `strict` column (all three conditions)? Add remote + push? Tune knobs (`DD_MIN`, `MIN_DOLLAR_VOL`) at top of scan.py.
